This was written quickly to be just a small front-end for the D&D Compendium. The service does plenty, so this just provides a mobile-friendly form for that. PHP was chosen as something easily tossed up on anyone's web hosting (so that this page could be hosted by anyone). 

Use of this page requires a working DDI account.

The icon.png was an attempt to have an icon when this is saved as an iPhone bookmark.
